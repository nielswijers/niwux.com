          architectures. Throughout my journey, I’ve worked alongside teams in
          industries ranging from health tech to fintech, building software
          that’s both high-performing and user-centric.

          intuitive, and built to last. I work closely with clients to bring
          their ideas to life, providing innovative, high-quality solutions that
          align with their vision and drive their business forward. Whether it’s
          a new application or a full-scale digital transformation, I’m here to
