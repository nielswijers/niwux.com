        <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 md:mt-10">
          With over a decade of experience in software development, I’ve
          dedicated my career to creating impactful solutions that solve real
          challenges. My expertise spans front-end and back-end technologies,
          from JavaScript and TypeScript to advanced web frameworks and cloud
          architectures. Throughout my journey, I’ve worked alongside teams in
          industries ranging from health tech to fintech, building software
          that’s both high-performing and user-centric.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
          At Niwux, I’m focused on delivering custom software that’s adaptable,
          intuitive, and built to last. I work closely with clients to bring
          their ideas to life, providing innovative, high-quality solutions that
          align with their vision and drive their business forward. Whether it’s
          a new application or a full-scale digital transformation, I’m here to
          create technology that empowers growth and meets the demands of
          tomorrow.
